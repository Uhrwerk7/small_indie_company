time of post -> 8.2:
anyways did some of u you reverse ObjAIBase class?
it has at GameObject + 0x23c0 a pointer the CharData ( in case if some1 needs  ) but i like to know, does anybody know when this pointer gets initilized? constructor of AIBaseClient/AIHeroClient etc do not set this pointer and ObjAIBase constructor/creator sets it as default to null -.-
